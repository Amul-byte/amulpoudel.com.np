      "title": "Real Estate Analytics – Gurgaon, India",
      "description": "Interactive data app to explore Gurgaon housing markets with maps, charts, and ML-powered insights.",
      "detailedDescription": "Built an end-to-end Streamlit dashboard to analyze residential listings in Gurgaon. The app features an interactive map of properties, BHK price distribution, composition breakdowns, and an Area-vs-Price scatter. It also includes a price-estimation workflow and a content-based recommender using cosine similarity of engineered features to find similar apartments. Visuals are rendered with Plotly; data processing uses Pandas/NumPy with cached pipelines for speed.",
